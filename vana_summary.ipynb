As a consequence, if one point is smaller than the constant term of the plane and the other is bigger, then they lay on opposite directions which is the case in this example. Another way to think of it is when you move along the line from $Q_0$ to $Q_1$, you will do this by changing $x, y, z$ only, hence you have to pass the value 7 as going from $3$ to $11$ and that is the intersection point.\n",

On the other hand, if $t = \\pi$ then $\\vec v(\\pi) = <1, 1>$ which tells the point moves the fastest when he is $2a$ above the ground, actually turned $180˚$ from its initial position. Why is that so? Well, as the point is $2a$ above ground, the velocity of the wheel moving forward and the velocity of the rotation add up as they perfectly move into the same direction. On the other hand, when the point is on the ground, the wheel moves into the opposite direction of the wheel rotation and the speeds cancel out to be 0.\n",
